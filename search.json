    "text": "Course Schedule & Assessment Plan\n\nSummary\nThis course guides students through the process of developing a reproducible pipeline to support biomedical informatics projects. Each 3 hour class is structured so that each lesson will provide a 30-60 minutes of lecture, followed by a 1-1.5 hour lab based activity where students learn and practice implementing the lesson's main concepts. This course employs a scaffolding framework in that each concept builds upon the next for facilitating the student's personal project. In-class activities will account for a small portion of the grade (5%), and are really meant as a low-stakes way of ensuring students are staying on track. The higher weighted assessments include the midterm and final project. However, the course is designed to provide repeated opportunities for students to gain feedback from classmates and the instructor to ensure they are staying up to date on the course material. Moreover, students are given the choice of how to present their final projects. This allows students to leverage their personal strengths to demonstrate understanding of the material. For example, students can elect to present their final project in the form of an oral presentation or a written report.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeek\nLesson\nActivity\nRationale\nWeight\n\n\n\n\n1\nIntroduction to Reproducibility in Biomedical Informatics\nIn-class discussion to assess student’s current understanding of reproducibility.\nHomework:\nResearch project abstract/proposal: Define data and question to answer\nIntroduce the importance of reproducibility in biomedical informatics and introduce students to the course project.\n5%\n\n\n2\nIntroduction to Github\nIn-class assignment to set up Github Repo and perform basic commands/functions\nEnsures that students are familiar with GitHub, a mainstay method of version control.\nThis class is a stepping stone to ensure they are set up to embark on their quarter long project.\n5%\n\n\n3\nSetting up project repository and pipeline\nIn-class assignment to review best practices for organizing Github repo and projects\nEnsures that students have set up their project repository and begin to learn about best practices for pipeline development.\n5%\n\n\n4\n Data acquisition and cleaning\nIn-class assignment to build a pipeline to import data.

    "text": "Course Description & Objectives\n\nCourse Description\nThere is an ongoing reproducibility crisis in science. Even computational research, which can avoid experimental variation from animal samples or environmental conditions, has fallen victim to poor reproducibility. For example, a recent study reported that the code from only 24% of Jupyter notebooks shared on GitHub, the most prominent version control resource, were successfully re-executed (Pimental, J. 2019).\nThis course aims to teach incoming biomedical informatics and data science students to recognize the importance of scientific reproducibility, and its crucial role in advancing scientific research. Throughout the quarter-long course, students will develop and execute their own fully reproducible analytic pipeline. Specifically, students will be tasked with constructing a pipeline to run a predictive model that will answer a research question of their choosing. Students may choose to work with publicly available omics or health-based datasets.\nEach week the course will introduce a new concept and its utility for ensuring scientific reproducibility. Students will have the opportunity to integrate this knowledge into their course projects. Course concepts and their utility for ensuring scientific reproducibility will be taught in a sequential, scaffolding-like manner covering the following:\n\nAcquisition and storage of data\nStructuring their computational workflow\nIncorporating GitHub for version control\nDocumenting their work\nTesting to ensure reproducibility\n\nThis class is crucial for ensuring that early biomedical informatics students will develop a deep understanding of scientific reproducibility before embarking on dissertation research projects and their future careers.\n\n\nCourse Objectives\nBy the end of the course, students will be able to:\n\nRecognize the importance of scientific reproducibility and the potential pitfalls when research is not reproducible\nDescribe best practices and tools for ensuring scientific reproducibility in biomedical informatics research\nImplement popular tools such as version control (GitHub) and best practices for data acquisition, code documentation, project structure and organization, and testing that will ensure scientific reproducibility.\nExecute a reproducible, computational pipeline implementing the tools and best practices learned throughout the course\n\n\nReview additional course materials:\n\nCourse Motivation\nCourse Schedule & Assessment Plan\nLesson Plan - Introduction to Github\n\nLesson Worksheet\nLesson Assessment"

    "text": "Lesson Plan\n\nLesson: Introduction to GitHub\n\nDuration: 3 hours\nIntended class size: ~20 students\n\n\n\nLesson Topic and Context\nGitHub is a mainstay method for ensuring reproducibility in data science and research settings. In this lesson, students will be introduced to GitHub as an essential tool for facilitating version control, and thus, scientific reproducibility. This course is designed for early students in biomedical informatics or data science programs who will also be conducting research. This lesson will be introduced early into the course (Lesson #2) once students have already received an overview of scientific reproducibility and its importance in biomedical research (Lesson #1). This lesson aims to give students a greater theoretical understanding of GitHub, in addition to a hands-on practicum.\n\n\nLesson Objectives\n\nDescribe the whats and hows of GitHub and recognize its role in facilitating scientific reproducibility for biomedical informatics research.\nImplement GitHub and its core functions on their own computers to gain hands-on experience with the ways in which these techniques may be applied to their own research and projects.\n\n\n\nSummary of Lesson\nAt the start of the class, students will be given a worksheet and asked to reflect on their experiences with reproducibility. Here, they will complete the first two pre-class exericses.\nDuring the lesson, students will create a Github Repository for their quarter-long project. They will then follow along with the instructor to perform a series of exercises to demonstrate knowledge of Github terms and concepts (e.g., ‘cloning’, ‘pushing’, ‘committing’, and ‘pulling’). Students will then break into groups and practice ‘cloning’ and ‘pulling’ each others’ sample repository and script.\nUpon the in-class and group exercises, the students will finish the remaining questions on the worksheet individually. The post-lesson questions provide an opportunity to demonstrate understanding of key terms and concepts from the lesson. Students will also have space to detail any remaining points of confusion. They will also be asked to reflect and consider how Github may best help them with their specific research and semester-long projects.\n\n\nLesson Timeline\n00:00 - 00:10: The class will begin with a review from concepts introduced in the previous lecture which covered the importance of scientific reproducibility. Students will be given a worksheet and asked to first reflect on the Pre-class question which provides an opportunity to think and describe their own experiences or thoughts regarding scientific reproducibility. In the last few minutes, students will be encouraged to discuss their experiences if they are comfortable doing so.\n00:10 - 00:25: A short PowerPoint presentation on GitHub and its use and pervasiveness among biomedical informatics and computational research domains.\n00:25 - 00:45: Students will have been asked to create a GitHub account prior to the start of class. The instructor will walk the students through connecting GitHub to their local RStudio environment. This process should not take long but built in time for troubleshooting has been considered.\n01:00 - 2:00: As a group, students will go through a series of exercises with the instructor to learn GitHub’s basic functions. Students will become familiar with key terms including repository, clone, pull, push, and commit.\nThese concepts will first be demonstrated through a combination of the GitHub webpage, RStudio, and the command-line. This portion of class will allow students and the instructor to go through the main functions of GitHub togetherstep by step - troubleshooting specific issues as they arise.\nSpecific exercises include: \n\nCreate a new GitHub repository\nClone the newly created GitHub repository onto their local computers\nPush a simple.R script to their repository\nCommit a change to their script\nPush the new commit to their repository\n\n01:30-01:45: Break \n01:45 - 2:15: Students will pair up in groups and will practice cloning and pulling each other’s sample repositories and scripts. Of note, if any students have trouble with any of the previous exercises, the instructor will work with them individually to troubleshoot.\n2:15 - 2:45: Students will take several minutes to reflect on the course and lesson activities. Here, they will be asked to complete a worksheet that will provide an opportunity to demonstrate understanding of key terms and concepts from the lesson. Students will also have space to detail any remaining points of confusion. They will also be asked to reflect and consider how GitHub may best help them with their specific research and semester-long projects.\n2:45 - 03:00: Students will turn in their worksheets and submit a link to their sample repository. The remainder of the class will be spent answering any final questions, or helping any students who may have run into technical issues during the class.\n\n\nLesson Assessment\nIn this lesson, basic working knowledge of GitHub will be assessed by reviewing each student’s repository and the log of changes they ‘committed’. A more detailed assessment plan and rubric can be found here\n\nReview additional course materials:\n\nCourse Motivation\nCourse Description & Objectives\nCourse Schedule & Assessment Plan"

    "text": "Methods for Reproducibility in Biomedical Informatics Research\n\n\nCourse Motivation\nMy course aims to emphasize the importance of scientific reproducibility in the midst of the current reproducibility crisis. Throughout the course, students will learn state of the art best practices to ensure they are stewards of scientific reproducibility in their research.\nIn designing this course, I adapted the framework of Northwestern University’s MS in Data Analytics program’s course: Analytics Value Chain. This course provides an in depth review of the steps needed to deploy models in production. While this course was focused more on business applications, I often thought about its relevance to scientific reproducibility. For myself and many of my fellow classmates, we were not formally taught best coding practices. Many of us are self-taught programmers and are learning best practices through painful trial and error. My own experiences have motivated me to create a course for computational researchers that will teach the best practices to ensure scientific reproducibility.\n\n\nRationale for Course Design\nDeveloping this course helped me to think more critically about the importance of scientific reproducibility and how to best structure each lesson to ensure students were learning the most salient course objectives. In a 10-week course, it is impossible to cover every strategy to ensure students are flawless leaders of scientific reproducibility. By carefully considering of the primary objectives of the course and applying a backward design approach, I was able to distill the most important, long-term objectives I want my students to take away from the course.\nAs such, the course-long project is designed to be highly hands-on and practical. Each class, students are given opportunities to learn and apply new computational concepts. Additionally, the course-long project allows students to choose their own dataset and problem to solve. Such flexibility is expected to encourage deeper and more significant learning of the course objectives. This framework can also help foster a more inclusive and equitable learning environment as students are welcome to choose a project that is of interest to them and which accommodates their own strengths and skills. Additionally, the inclusion of group-based activities is designed to facilitate heightened engagement, content retention, and future collaboration among the lecturer and students - important traits for budding informaticians and researchers.\nAs demonstrated in my Introduction to GitHub Lesson, I also attempt to provide students with opportunities for meta-cognition. The inclusion of pre-class and post-class exercises are designed to help students solidify the main concepts they are learning and to think critically about how they may use the lesson’s tools and strategies in their own research. Through such meta-cognitive exercises, a deeper understanding of the material can be obtained.\n\n\nRationale for Assessment\nSince my course aims to ensure an equitable classroom environment among students of different academic backgrounds, I thought carefully about how to assess student performance. Overall, a student’s participation and engagement of in-class activities are weighted much more heavily than individual assignments. As my Assessment Plan describes, the course follows a scaffolding structure in which students will learn skills and concepts each week that can be used to complete their final class project. This Assessment Plan is designed to provide opportunities to gauge the student’s progress throughout the course and intervene when students may be falling behind. Overall, the course uses a practical assignment to equip students with the required skills to become leaders in biomedical informatics and stewards of scientific reproducibility.\n\nView course materials:\n\nCourse Description & Objectives\nCourse Schedule & Assessment Plan\nLesson Plan - Introduction to Github\n\nLesson Worksheet\nLesson Assessment"
