#### **Methods for Reproducibility in Biomedical Informatics Research**

## Course Schedule & Assessment Plan

### Summary

This course guides students through the process of developing a reproducible pipeline to support biomedical informatics projects. Each 3 hour class is structured so that each lesson will provide a 30-60 minutes of lecture, followed by a 1-1.5 hour lab based activity where students learn and practice implementing the lesson\'s main concepts. This course employs a scaffolding framework in that each concept builds upon the next for facilitating the student\'s personal project. In-class activities will account for a small portion of the grade (5%), and are really meant as a low-stakes way of ensuring students are staying on track. The higher weighted assessments include the midterm and final project. However, the course is designed to provide repeated opportunities for students to gain feedback from classmates and the instructor to ensure they are staying up to date on the course material. Moreover, students are given the choice of how to present their final projects. This allows students to leverage their personal strengths to demonstrate understanding of the material. For example, students can elect to present their final project in the form of an oral presentation or a written report.
