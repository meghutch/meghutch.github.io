Throughout the course, students will learn state of the art best practices to ensure they are stewards of scientific reproducibility in their research.\n\nIn designing this course, I adapted the framework employed by Northwestern University's MS in Data Analytics program's course: Analytics Value Chain. This course was phenomenal in teaching all the steps required for creating a predictive model and deploying it into production. While this course was focused more on business applications, I often thought about its relevance to scientific reproducibility. For many of my fellow biomedical informatics peers and me, we were not formally taught best practices for coding. Many of us are self-taught and are learning best practices through painful trial and error. Additionally, there were not any dedicated courses in my program's biomedical informatics curriculum that focused on best software practices for facilitating scientific reproducibility. My own experiences have motivated me to create a course for computational researchers that will teach the fundamentals and best practices for ensuring scientific reproducibility.\n\n### Rationale for Course Design\n\nDeveloping this course helped me to think more critically about the importance of scientific reproducibility and how to best structure each lesson to ensure students were learning the most salient course objectives. In a 10-week course, it is near impossible to review all of the material students need to learn to be flawless leaders of scientific reproducibility. By careful consideration of the primary objectives of the course and applying a backward design approach, I was able to distill the most important, long-term objectives I want my students to take away from the course. As such, the course-long project is designed to be highly hands-on and practical. Students are given opportunities in each class lesson to learn and apply new computational concepts for ensuring reproducibility. Additionally, the course-long project allows students to choose their own dataset and problem to solve. Such flexibility is expected to encourage deeper and more significant learning of the course objectives. This can also help foster a more inclusive and equitable learning environment as students are welcome to choose a project that is of interest to them and which accommodates their own strengths and skills. Moreover, the structured in-class exercises can create a more engaging and active learning experience and help ensure that technical challenges and problems can be addressed in real time with the instructor. Additionally, the inclusion of group-based activities is designed to facilitate heightened engagement, content retention, and future collaboration among the lecturer and students - important traits for budding informaticians and researchers.\n\nAs demonstrated in my Introduction to GitHub Lesson, I also attempt to provide students with opportunities for meta-cognition. The inclusion of pre-class and post-class exercises are designed to help students solidify the main concepts they are learning and to think critically about how they may use the lesson's tools and strategies in their own research. Through such meta-cognitive exercises, a deeper understanding of the material can be obtained.\n\n### Rationale for Assessment\n\nSince my course aims to ensure an equitable classroom environment among students of different academic backgrounds, I thought carefully about how to assess student performance. Overall, a student's participation and engagement of in-class activities are weighted much more heavily than assignments. As my Assessment Plan describes, the course follows a scaffolding structure in that students will learn skills and concepts each week that will be used to complete their final class project. The Assessment Plan is designed to provide opportunities to gauge the student's progress throughout the course and intervene when students may be falling behind. Overall, the course aims to equip students with the required skills to become leaders in biomedical informatics, through a practical and relevant assignment without additional overt stress from too many difficult assignments.\n\n---\n\n**View course materials:**\n\n-   [**Course Description & Objectives**](course_description_objectives.qmd)\n\n-   [**Course Schedule & Assessment Plan**](schedule_assessment_plan.qmd)\n\n-   [**Lesson Plan - Introduction to Github**](lesson_plan.qmd)\n\n    -   [**Lesson Worksheet**](lesson_worksheet.qmd)\n    -   [**Lesson Assessment**](lesson_assessment.qmd)\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n#### **Methods for Reproducibility in Biomedical Informatics Research**\n\n### Course Motivation\n\nMy course: \"Methods for reproducibility in biomedical informatics research\" aims to emphasize the importance of scientific reproducibility and the current reproducibility crisis.
