### Teaching ePortfolio

During my participation in Northwestern University's [Reflective and Effective Teaching Program](https://searle.northwestern.edu/programs-services/programs/program-pages/reflective-and-effective-teaching.html), I designed a course, "Methods for reproducibility in biomedical informatics research", to serve as an introduction to the importance of scientific reproducibility and best coding practices.

The below links comprise my ePortfolio of teaching materials developed for my envisioned course.

-   [**Course Motivation**](motivation.qmd)
